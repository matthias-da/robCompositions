}
\details{
The general government sector consists of central, 
state and local governments, and the social security funds controlled 
by these units. The data are based on the system of national accounts,

and rules for national accounting. The classification of functions of government 
(COFOG) is used as classification system. 
The central government spending by category is measured as a percentage 
of total expenditures.
