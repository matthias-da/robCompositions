Description: The package includes methods for imputation 
             of compositional data including robust methods, methods to impute rounded zeros, 
             (robust) outlier detection for compositional data, 
             (robust) principal component
             analysis for compositional data, (robust) factor analysis for compositional 
             data, (robust) discriminant analysis for compositional data (Fisher rule), robust regression with compositional predictors and (robust) 
             Anderson-Darling normality tests
             for compositional data as well as popular log-ratio transformations (addLR, cenLR, isomLR, 
             and their inverse transformations).
             In addition, visualisation and diagnostic tools are implemented as well as high and low-level plot functions for the 
             ternary diagram.
